## Problem Statement:
The stakeholders currently have only one physical retail store, limiting the potential to reach more clients.
They are looking to expand the business to more clients through a digital platform.

## Proposition:
Creating an online marketplace which allows users to browse the current poster inventory of the shop owner, and allows users to upload their images and purchase their custom poster art. This can expand the owners business to a broader customer base.

## Requirements:
Gallery to display current inventory,
user image upload and preview, 
delete user upload option.

## Target End Users:
Clients that are not near the geographic location of the company retail store as well as
clients that want to have custom poster art.

## Next Steps:
Create add to cart, check out functionality.
Add purchase functionality.
Add authentication functionality.
